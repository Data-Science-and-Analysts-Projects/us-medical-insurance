    "The data for this project can be found on [Kaggle, Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance). There are 7 columns:\n",
    "1. age - age of primary beneficiary\n",
    "2. sex - insurance contractor gender: male or female\n",
    "3. bmi - Body Mass Index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m^2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9\n",
    "4. children - number of children covered by health insurance, ie - the number of dependents\n",
    "5. smoker - represents if the primary beneficiary is a smoker: yes or no\n",
    "6. region - the beneficiary's residential area in the US: northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest\n",
    "7. charges - individual medical costs billed by the health insurance\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 1,338 observations in the dataset. There are no NA values in the dataset, and the types of the columns in the DataFrame look to be accurately predicted. Therefore, there will be little to no data cleaning. \n",
