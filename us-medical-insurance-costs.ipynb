    "1. age - age of primary beneficiary\n",
    "2. sex - insurance contractor gender: male or female\n",
    "3. bmi - Body Mass Index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m^2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9\n",
    "4. children - number of children covered by health insurance, ie - the number of dependents\n",
    "5. smoker - represents if the primary beneficiary is a smoker: yes or no\n",
    "6. region - the beneficiary's residential area in the US: northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest\n",
    "7. charges - individual medical costs billed by the health insurance\n",
